## Description

As a developer, it is important to be able to use real world timing in applications. This week's challenge was to have the work day scheduler be able to display the current hour, as well as saving the data to local storage. This was accomplished using Day.js, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to target individual id's based off the time to have the same or different styling. I learned a lot about how to incorporate real world timing, and specific targeting of elements that share properties.

## Installation

1. Go to repository main page.
2. Click the green `<> Code` button.
3. Click the SSH button under the Clone heading, and copy the link.
4. Open the terminal.
5. `cd` into the location you want the file to be stored.
6. type `git clone`, and then paste the URL that was copied.
7. Press enter, and you should see a message containing "Cloning into 'directory name'...",meaning you are successful.
8. Open VS Code using `code .` and the copied repository should be there.

## Usage

1. Type anything into a textbox next to the desired time.
2. Click the save icon button on the right next to the corresponding time.
3. An "Event Saved!" message will show up at the top of the page, confirming the event to be saved.
4. The webpage can now be refreshed or closed, and the information will be stored.
5. The `Clear All` button can be pressed, and a message displaying "All Events Cleared!" will appear.
6. All event textboxes will be cleared, and information in local storage will be deleted.
